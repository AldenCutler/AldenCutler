Hi, I'm Alden Cutler!

I'm currently a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Computer Science, along with a specialization in Computer Security and a minor in Data Science.
Outside of school, I live in Seattle, WA, and I enjoy video games, chess, reading books, playing and watching soccer, and listening to music. 
You can reach me at aldencutler84@gmail.com. :)
