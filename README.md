Hi, I'm Alden Cutler!

I'm currently a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), in Worcester, MA, and majoring in Computer Science, but when I'm not at school I live in Seattle, WA.
My hobbies include video games, chess, reading books, playing and watching soccer, and listening to music. 
You can reach me at aldencutler84@gmail.com. :)
